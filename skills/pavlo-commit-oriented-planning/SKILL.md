# Skill: Step-Oriented Planning

Framework for breaking down a task into logically independent,
testable steps.
Each step represents a single cohesive unit of work
that can stand alone —
all tests pass after applying it,
and it results in a single git commit.

## When to Use

When planning a complex feature, refactoring,
or multi-step task.
Helps ensure:
- Clear communication (each step has a clear purpose)
- Easier code review
  (reviewers understand intent per step)
- Safer rollback
  (a broken step can be reverted independently)
- Better git history
  (clear cause-and-effect, no intermingled concerns)

## Principles

1. **One logical unit per step**:
   Each step should address a single concern —
   one feature, one refactoring, one set of tests,
   or one documentation update.
2. **Tests pass after every step**:
   After applying a step,
   the test suite should pass.
   This enables bisecting and selective reverting.
3. **Independent verification**:
   A code reviewer should be able to understand
   the step's purpose
   without context from other steps in the series.
4. **Ordered by dependency**:
   If Step B depends on infrastructure from Step A,
   list A first.

## Planning Process

1. **Break down the task** into smaller pieces:
   - Infrastructure changes (types, entities, repositories)
   - Service/business logic changes
   - Integration into use cases or adapters
   - Tests for each component
   - Documentation updates

2. **Group by cohesion**:
   - Don't mix unrelated changes
     (e.g., don't add a new feature
     and refactor unrelated code in one step)
   - Don't split a logical unit
     (e.g., a feature + its tests should be one step)

3. **Order by dependency**:
   - If Step B uses something introduced in Step A,
     put A first
   - Abstract types (interfaces)
     often come before implementations
   - Domain logic often comes before adapters

4. **Number and name clearly**:
   - Use format: `Step 1: ...`, `Step 2: ...`
   - Use a short title describing the one thing
     this step does
   - Optional: add a scope
     (e.g., `Step 3: [domain/services] Add X validation`)

5. **Estimate scope**:
   - Small steps (~50–150 lines changed)
     are easier to review
   - Complex steps may be larger
     but should still address a single concept

6. **Cross-reference the ticket**:
   - Where the ticket provides detailed specifications,
     pseudocode,
     or code drafts
     (e.g., an implementation sketch, an ABC signature,
     a helper function body),
     add an explicit cross-reference
      in the step description pointing to the exact
      ticket section
      (e.g., "`PROJ-42_ticket.md` R2,
      code block 'Implementation Sketch'").
   - The plan must be self-sufficient
     for step ordering and scope,
     but it must not duplicate large code blocks
     from the ticket.
     Instead, reference them
     so the implementer knows where to look.
   - Every step that implements a ticket requirement
     with non-trivial specification detail
     should include at least one such reference.

7. **Self-verify and auto-fix**
   (see [Plan Self-Verification](#plan-self-verification)
   below):
   - Run the verification checklist against the draft plan
   - Fix every found issue directly in the plan file
   - Only present the plan to the user
     after verification passes

## Plan Self-Verification

After producing the initial draft plan,
**before presenting it to the user**,
run through the following checklist automatically.
Fix every issue found directly in the plan.
Do not ask the user for permission to fix —
just fix and note what changed.

### Checklist

#### Logical issues

- **No circular dependencies** —
  Step B must not require something introduced in Step C
  if C comes after B.
  Fix by reordering steps.

- **No broken-test steps** —
  after every step, all tests must pass.
  If a step introduces code whose tests live in a later step,
  either merge the tests into the same step
  or ensure the code is unreachable / untested-but-passing
  until the test step.

- **No split logical units** —
  a feature and its direct tests should be in the same step
  unless the test step is explicitly a bulk test step
  covering multiple features.

- **No vague or mixed-concern steps** —
  each step title must name one specific change.
  If a step description lists unrelated items, split it.

- **Correct layer ordering** —
  domain steps before application steps,
  application steps before adapter steps.
  Flag and reorder any violation.

#### Ticket consistency

- **All In Scope items are covered** —
  every item in the ticket's `## Scope → In Scope` section
  must map to at least one step.
  Flag any uncovered scope item and add a step for it.

- **No Out of Scope items are planned** —
  if a step description implements something listed under
  `## Scope → Out of Scope`, remove or revise it.

- **Requirements are fully addressed** —
  every `### R<N>` section in the ticket
  must be traceable to at least one step.
  Flag gaps and add steps.

- **Acceptance Criteria are traceable** —
  every checkbox in `## Acceptance Criteria`
  must be achievable by the steps as planned.
  Flag any criterion that no step addresses.

- **Documentation step is always last** —
  every plan must end with an "Update documentation" step.
  This step updates whatever documentation is relevant
  in the repository (README, API docs, inline docs, etc.).
  It must always be the final step in the plan,
  even if the ticket does not explicitly mention docs.

### After Fixing

Append a short `## Verification Notes` section
at the bottom of the plan file
listing what was changed during self-verification
(e.g., "Reordered steps 3 and 4 to fix dependency order",
"Added Step 7 to cover R8 —
Activation-Interval Coverage Test").
If nothing needed fixing, write "No issues found."

## Example Structure

```markdown
## Plan: Add new feature X

### Step 1: [domain/entities] Define Foo entity
- Add `Foo` immutable Pydantic model with fields a, b, c

### Step 2: [domain/services] Add FooService business logic
- Add stateless `FooService.process(foo)` method
- Pure domain logic, no dependencies on adapters

### Step 3: [application/use_cases] Add ProcessFooUseCase
- Orchestrate domain service with repository
- Inject `FooService` and `FooRepository`

### Step 4: [adapters/outbound] Implement FooRepository
- In-memory dict implementation for storage
- Register in DI container

### Step 5: [tests] Add comprehensive test suite
- Domain tests for FooService
- Application tests for ProcessFooUseCase (with mocks)
- Adapter tests for FooRepository

### Step 6: [docs] Update documentation
- Update relevant repository documentation
  (README, API docs, inline docs, etc.)
```

> **Note:** The documentation step is always the last step
> in every plan, regardless of whether the ticket
> explicitly requires it.

## Benefits

- **Easier code review**:
  Reviewers see one logical change at a time
- **Safer merging**:
  Each step is independently testable and reversible
- **Better blame history**:
  `git blame` shows intent per line,
  not side-effects from unrelated changes
- **Incremental CI**:
  CI can run tests after each step, catching issues early
- **Flexible rebasing**:
  You can reorder, squash,
  or cherry-pick commits more easily

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ One mega-step with mixed concerns
  (feature + refactoring + tests)
- ❌ Steps that break tests
  (even if "fixed in the next step")
- ❌ Splitting a logical unit across steps for no reason
- ❌ Vague step titles ("WIP", "cleanup", "fix stuff")
- ❌ Circular dependencies
  (Step A depends on B, B depends on A)
- ❌ Including Jira ticket metadata JSON blocks
  (ticket, epic, type, priority, labels, components,
  story_points, sprint, etc.) in the plan.
  The plan is about steps, not ticket bookkeeping.
  Omit any such JSON metadata entirely.
